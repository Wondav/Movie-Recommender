# Movie-Rating-Prediction
This is to create a repos for movie rating prediction. It covers 3 use cases. 

1) Predict user rating from 0 to 5 by creating a stacked auto-encoder netowrk. 

2) Predict user likes or not by creating a restricted Boltzmann machine. 

3) use Pearson correlation matrix and create an item-based movie recommender.

******Production and deployment level codes are to be opened soon. Stay tuned.******
