# Movie-Rating-Prediction
This is to create a repos for movie rating prediction. It covers 3 use cases. 

One is to predict user rating from 0 to 5 by creating a stacked auto-encoder netowrk. 

Another one is to predict user likes or not by creating a restricted Boltzmann machine. 

The final one is to use Pearson correlation matrix and create an item-based movie recommender.

******Production and deployment level codes are to be opened soon. Stay tuned.******
